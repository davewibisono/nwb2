    - title: "Report"
      content: "The final report for NeuroDataReHack 2023 is now available online at [<a href=''>PDF (GitHub)</a>] [<a href=''>LaTeX (Overleaf)</a>]."
    - title: "Dates and Location"
      content: "Dates: September 5-8, 2023 <br><br> Location: <a href=''>Hotel Andalucia Center in Granada, Spain (google maps)</a>"
    - title: "Objective"
      content: "The <a href=''>DANDI Archive</a> now has 110+ neurophysiology datasets in the <a href=''>Neurodata Without Borders</a> format spanning many species, brain areas, task types, and imaging modalities. These include high-value datasets, e.g. from The Allen Institute, the MICrONS project, and the International Brain Laboratory, as well as diverse contributions from neuroscience labs around the world. In this workshop, we will teach attendees about the open neurophysiology datasets available on the DANDI Archive and train them on how to maximally utilize the archive and the NWB standard to incorporate existing data into their scientific workflows. Feedback from attendees will be used to improve the software and data standard to better enable reanalysis workflows. <br><br> Prior to the workshop, we are organizing <a href=''>Open Neurodata Showcase</a> where attendees can meet the contributors behind the neurophysiology datasets and explore virtual posters. Visit the <a href=''>event page</a> to sign up and read more about this feature event. <br><br> Example projects include but are not limited to:<br><li>Determine whether your result is present in another species or brain area.</li><li>Showcase the capabilities of your tool or analysis on existing data from another lab.</li><li>Explore follow-up questions to a study.</li><br><br>Following the event, participants will be invited to apply for a Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award, which awards $50,000 (USD) of funding to continue data reanalysis projects that come out of the NeuroDataReHack event. Details about the Kavli Foundation Neurodata Discovery Award will be provided closer to the event.<br><br>This event is held as a satellite of the IBRO World Congress 2023 with the goal of making it more accessible to diverse participants who might not otherwise have the opportunity to participate in this workshop. Attendance of IBRO 2023 is not a requirement for application.<br><br>This event will primarily focus on analyzing existing data in NWB and on DANDI, not converting data to NWB. If you are interested in learning how to convert data, consider signing up for an NWB User Days event."
