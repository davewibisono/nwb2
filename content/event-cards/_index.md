  title: NWB Hackathons
  content: The NWB Hackathons are hands-on activities lasting several days in
    which neurophysiology researchers and software developers create solutions
    using the open source NWB software ecosystem. <br><br> Participants work
    collaboratively on solutions that use the NWB unified data format for
    cellular-based neurophysiology data. In contrast to conferences and
    workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the
    Hackathons is to provide a venue for creators and users of neurophysiology
    open-source software to collaboratively work on NWB-related research
    projects. <br><br> For more information about past and upcoming hackathons,
